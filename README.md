Example of a good and clean application architecture in Golang with framework Gin.

in this example, I demonstrate how to structure a scalabel, maintainable and clean web application using Golang and the Gin framework. I`ll use key Go concepts like clean separation of concerns and efficient error handling.

List of used libraries/utilits/frameworks:
* ```"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"``` - One of the best Golang frameworks for building HTTP applications.
* ```"github.com/gin-contrib/cors"``` - To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing secure cross-origin-requests. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Mozilla Documentation</a>
